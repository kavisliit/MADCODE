Because of this pandemic situation most of the people in the world are stayed in their homes. So, they spend their time mostly on indoor activities. Reading books is the most popular and most valuable hobby among all activities. But because of this pandemic situation people cannot get any books from bookshops and they cannot find books that they interested .In order solve this problem we developed the “Pick a Book”, that is a book sharing application that focus on connect book lovers  with each other.
This is not an ordinary book buy and selling application. From this application users can gain many services. Users can register to the system by providing their information to the application and then they can get all the services of the application without any payment. Users can add books that they interested  to share, to the application. All users can view the books that added to share. User can also request for books through this application that means if user want to get any book, he/she can add a request to the application that saying that he/she need that book. If one user needs to get a book that added by another user, he/she can contact the user that added that specific book through this application. So, this might be very good application to book lovers.
User can also organize events related to the books through this application. Once user added a new event to the application, he/she need to provide the Date, time, venue, and maximum numbers of members that related to that event. Other users can view all the events available in the application and they can join any event that they interested.
